# 🚀 Welcome to PR-CYBR! 🚀

_Protegiendo a los que no ven — safeguarding those who cannot see._

</div>

PR-CYBR is a Puerto Rico initiative for digital resilience and next-generation technology exploration. We are a community dedicated to helping people understand and **see the unseen** through technology and education. Our motto, "helping those who cannot see," guides us in building tools and programs that illuminate hidden threats and opportunities so communities can thrive.

## 🎯 Our Mission

To empower communities with ethical technology, education and preparedness so they can protect themselves and others. Guided by the Seven Hermetic Principles, we merge cybersecurity, AI/ML, space systems and psionics with humanitarian values to foster awareness, resilience and intergenerational stewardship.

## 🧭 Current Initiatives

- **Watchdogs** – Building community-driven monitoring systems that detect and report cyber and physical threats, enabling neighbours to protect one another.
- **PR-CYBR-DIV** – Establishing decentralised network nodes (Divisions) at the municipal level where volunteers can collaborate and share resources for digital resilience.
- **PR-CYBR-AGENTS** – Developing AI-augmented agents to automate research, development, testing and deployment of solutions to real-time problems, bringing full digital autonomy to our workflows.
- **TOC-OPs** – Teaching community members to set up localised Technical Operations Centers for disaster response, search and rescue and incident management.
- **SAT-DB** – Indexing satellites orbiting Earth and throughout the solar system to create an open-source, immersive visualisation of near real-time orbital assets.
