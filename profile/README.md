# üöÄ Welcome to PR-CYBR! üöÄ

_Protegiendo a los que no ven ‚Äî safeguarding those who cannot see._

</div>

PR-CYBR is a Puerto Rico initiative for digital resilience and next-generation technology exploration. We are a community dedicated to helping people understand and **see the unseen** through technology and education. Our motto, "helping those who cannot see," guides us in building tools and programs that illuminate hidden threats and opportunities so communities can thrive.

## üéØ Our Mission

To empower communities with ethical technology, education and preparedness so they can protect themselves and others. Guided by the Seven Hermetic Principles, we merge cybersecurity, AI/ML, space systems and psionics with humanitarian values to foster awareness, resilience and intergenerational stewardship.
